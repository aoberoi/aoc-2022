# Advent of Code 2022

This repo contains my solutions to the [challenges](https://adventofcode.com/2022). If you don't want spoilers, don't
read my code!

I chose to write my solutions in TypeScript running on [Deno](https://deno.land/). While I have plenty of experience
writing JavaScript and TypeScript for browser and node, I haven't had much practical experience with Deno. This seems
like a fun way to kick the tires and learn about some of the differences.
